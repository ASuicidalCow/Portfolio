          <h2 className='mt-4'> I grew up in little Casper, Wyoming where I lived for 17 years before moving to my current home state of Utah with my parents. I then started what I thought was going to be my career for life at FedEx. I had realized that this was not the career I wanted. I searched and went to different colleges to find something that fit me and nothing quite stuck until I found computer programming where I discovered a love of problem solving and creating things that others might possible find useful or that I find useful for my self. Although, I am less experienced my thirst for knowledge has helped me through a brutal 24 week coding bootcamp through the University of Utah with high marks.   </h2>
